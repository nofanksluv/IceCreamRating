# Rate Your Ice Cream
## Description
This web app is a fun project for everyone to rate different ice cream flavours. Upon clicking on one of the 127 profiles, you will see a recipe on how to recreate it at home if you cannot find the flavour in shops. Secondly, there will be a 5-star rating system for you to express your love (or hate) for the flavour.

## Inspiration
Since WAs are stressful, I want to create something fun while still learning. As someone who loves ice cream and is always searching for new flavours, I hope to give others and myself a gauge of how each fundamental flavours ranks.

## Development process
This web app uses Flask, Python, and SQLite3 for the backend development while the frontend uses HTML and CSS. Specifically, the 5-star rating system was built purely using CSS.

## Challenges and Learning Curves
When starting the project, I knew there were going to be challenges. Two of the biggest ones were the rating system and managing my database. It took me a while to settle on a way to create the rating system as there are many different examples. In the end, I chose to create it using only CSS as it is a language that I am familiar with. As for the database, although I did have some experience, using SQL, applying it in Python was a foreign concept at the time. It took a lot of trial and error to not only get the code running but to also ensure that the formatting of each entry was consistent. Another challenge I saw was the embedding of recipe sites. Before the project, I did not know that some sites had security blocks for iframe. This caused about 90% of the recipes to not appear on my web app. Eventually, I had to manually replace all the blocked sites and was glad it finished in time.

## Future plans
I hope to make this available permanently as PythonAnywhere unfortunately will only host my site for 3 months. I would also like to add more features to the app such as text-based reviews as well as alter the ranking system so that it also considers the number of reviews.

Recipe links and images were collected by me and are used for educational purposes only. The descriptions of each flavour are of my own.
