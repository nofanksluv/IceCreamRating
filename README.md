## Rate Your Ice Cream
# Description
This web app is a fun project for everyone to rate different ice cream flavours. As someone who loves ice cream and is always searching for new flavours, I hope to give others and myself a gauge of how each fundamental flavours ranks. Upon clicking on one of the 127 profiles, you will see a recipe on how to recreate it at home if you cannot find the flavour in shops. Secondly, there will be a 5-star rating system for you to express your love (or hate) for the flavour.

# Development process
This web app uses Flask, Python, and SQLite3 for the backend development while the frontend uses HTML and CSS. When starting the project, I knew there were going to be challenges. Two of the biggest ones were the rating system and managing my database. It took me a while to settle on a way to create the rating system as there are many different examples. In the end, I chose to create it using only CSS as it is a language that I am familiar with. As for the database, although I did have some experience, using SQL in Python was a foreign concept at the time. This took a lot of trial and error to not only get the code running but to also ensure that the formatting of each entry was consistent.
